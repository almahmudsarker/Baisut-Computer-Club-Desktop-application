************ Architecture *************

I used the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in this project. In this architecture, the application is divided into three components: the Model, which represents the data and business logic; the View, which represents the user interface; and the Controller, which handles the communication between the Model and the View.
Pros
•	Separation of concerns: MVC architecture separates the application into three distinct components, which allows for easier maintenance, testing, and modification of individual components without affecting the others.
•	Reusability: Because of the separation of concerns, each component can be reused in other applications, which can save time and resources.
•	Scalability: The MVC architecture is highly scalable and can accommodate changing requirements and growing user bases.
Cons
•	Complexity: Implementing an MVC architecture can be complex, especially for small applications or inexperienced developers.
•	Steep learning curve: Developers need to have a solid understanding of the architecture and its components to implement it effectively.
•	Overhead: Because of the separation of concerns, there can be additional overhead in terms of code and processing time.

I use this Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for the BAIUST computer club management system for the following reasons:

1.	Separation of concerns: The MVC architecture separates the application logic into three interconnected components, namely the Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller (handles user input and updates the Model and View). This separation of concerns makes it easier to maintain and modify different parts of the application without affecting the other parts. For example, if you need to change the user interface, you can modify the View component without changing the underlying data and business logic in the Model component.

2.	Improved code organization: The MVC architecture encourages better code organization, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain the application. Each component has a clear responsibility, which makes it easier to identify and fix bugs.

3.	Code reusability: By separating the application logic into three distinct components, the MVC architecture encourages code reuse. The Model and Controller components can be reused in other parts of the application or in other applications, making it easier to develop new features and applications.

4.	Ease of testing: The MVC architecture makes it easier to test the application, as each component can be tested independently. This allows for more thorough testing of the application, which can improve the overall quality of the application.

5.	Popular and well-supported: The MVC architecture is a widely used and well-established architecture for web applications. This means that there are plenty of resources, tools, and frameworks available to help you develop your application.

Overall, the use of the MVC architecture can lead to a more organized, maintainable, and scalable application. However, it's important to note that the selection of an architecture should be based on the specific requirements of the project, and other architectures may also be suitable depending on the project's needs.
Here are some Verification and Validation (V&V) activities that can be performed for the BAIUST computer club management system:

************ Verification activities *************

1.	Code Review: Code review is a static V&V technique that can help identify defects in the code before the code is executed. A team of developers can review the code to ensure that it adheres to best practices and follows the coding standards set for the project.
2.	Unit Testing: Unit testing is a dynamic V&V technique that can help ensure that individual units of code perform as expected. Developers can create automated unit tests for each unit of code to verify that it functions correctly.
3.	Integration Testing: Integration testing is a dynamic V&V technique that can help ensure that the different components of the system work together as expected. Developers can perform integration testing to verify that the modules are integrated correctly and produce the expected output.
4.	System Testing: System testing is a dynamic V&V technique that can help ensure that the system functions as expected. System testing can be performed to verify that the system meets the requirements and specifications.

************ Validation activities **************

1.	Acceptance Testing: Acceptance testing is a dynamic V&V technique that can help ensure that the system meets the customer's requirements. The BAIUST computer club members can perform acceptance testing to ensure that the system meets their expectations.
2.	User Testing: User testing is a dynamic V&V technique that can help ensure that the system meets the end-users' requirements. The BAIUST computer club members can perform user testing to ensure that the system meets their needs and is easy to use.
3.	Performance Testing: Performance testing is a dynamic V&V technique that can help ensure that the system performs as expected under various workloads. Developers can perform performance testing to ensure that the system can handle the expected number of users and transactions.
These V&V activities can help ensure that the BAIUST computer club management system meets the requirements and specifications, functions correctly, and meets the end-users' expectations. By performing these activities, the team can identify defects early in the development lifecycle and ensure that the system is of high quality.
